# For Node Selector & Node affinty
This is based on node labels

To add labels to a node, use the kubectl label command. 
For example, to add a label disktype=ssd to a node, use the following command:

kubectl label nodes <node-name> accelerator: nvidia-gpu



# For Taints and Tolerations

To tolerate a taint, you can specify toleration in the pod specification. For example, the following pod specification tolerates the taint "disktype=ssd" with a toleration period of 3600 seconds:

kubectl taint nodes <node-name> special=true:NoSchedule

# Pod Affinity

This is based on pod labels
